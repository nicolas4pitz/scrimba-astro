A responsive web project that recreates the look and feel of the **Netflix** interface.  
This clone allows users to explore movie and series pages, view detailed information, and watch trailers directly within the site — replicating the immersive Netflix experience.

Developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, the project focuses on front-end structure and interactivity.  
It includes elements such as navigation menus, movie banners, modals, and embedded video playback.  
The design mirrors Netflix’s minimalist and cinematic style, featuring smooth transitions, dark themes, and highlighted call-to-action buttons.

This project demonstrates strong attention to UI/UX detail, DOM manipulation, and the use of CSS for layout and animation effects.
