NFT Marketplace is a modern, responsive landing page designed for buying and selling digital art as NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens).  
This project showcases a complete front-end interface that simulates a crypto-based marketplace, featuring live auctions, top sellers, and an exploration section for browsing digital collectibles.

The design follows current UI/UX trends with **gradient backgrounds**, **glassmorphism effects**, and **hover animations** that create an immersive experience. The color palette combines deep blues and vibrant pinks to evoke a futuristic, crypto-native aesthetic.

The layout is built with **semantic HTML5** and styled using **custom CSS** alongside **Bootstrap 5** for responsive utilities. All components are modular and easily customizable, making it a great starting point for anyone looking to build or prototype an NFT platform.

The goal of this project is to provide a clean, visually appealing template that demonstrates front-end skills while exploring the aesthetics of the Web3 and blockchain space.
